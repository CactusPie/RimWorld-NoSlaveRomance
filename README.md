A RimWorld mod

This mod prevents slaves from falling in love.
Only prevents new romance from occurring, it will not affect any existing romances.

Mod settings allow you to enable or disable the following options:
- Prevent slaves from romancing other slaves
- Prevent slaves from romancing colonists

By default both settings are enabled, which means all romance for slaves will be disabled.

Required mod: Harmony.
